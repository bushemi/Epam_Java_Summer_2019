Console application for basic calculation operations.
 It consumes exactly 3 parameters - number number operation.
 4 operators could be - + / *
 Also was added compatibility with a small english letter x as a replacement of * because some consoles cant work with *
 To use our application you should go to the calc-console module and run "mvn install" after you will have a folder "target" with a jar file.
 You can run it from console by the command "java -jar App.jar [parameter1] [parameter2] [operator]" without brackets or quotation marks.
 Thank You.
